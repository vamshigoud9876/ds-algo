Avoiding duplicates in subsets:
    1. SubsetsII -> https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/
    2. NonDecreasingSubsequences -> https://leetcode.com/problems/non-decreasing-subsequences/

    -> Making choices:
        if a duplicate number's first occurrence is already picked in previous
               recursion call then always pick it. don't unpick it.
        So, if processed.last == cur[ind], then just pick it, don't call for unpick.
        Since its already handled in prev recursion where same number is ignored first and later added.
