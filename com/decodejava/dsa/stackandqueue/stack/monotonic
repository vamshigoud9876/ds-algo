ðŸ”¥ Famous & Classic Problems:
1. Sum of All Subarray Minimums

ðŸ”— LeetCode 907: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums

    Use: Monotonic stack + contribution

    Formula: Each element's count as minimum = (i - PLE[i]) * (NLE[i] - i)

2. Sum of All Subarray Maximums

ðŸ”— LeetCode 2104 variation (or implement yourself)

    Same idea but reversed inequality for max.

3. Total Strength of Wizards

ðŸ”— LeetCode 2281: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-total-strength-of-wizards

    Advanced: Combines prefix sums and contribution with minimums.

    This is a very popular hard problem that heavily tests these principles.

4. Sum of Subarray Ranges

ðŸ”— LeetCode 2104: https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-ranges

    Ask for the difference between subarray max and min.

    You compute contribution of each element as max and as min.

5. Sum of All Subarrays (basic version)

    For any arr[i], how many subarrays include it? Use:
    (i+1)â‹…(nâˆ’i)
    (i+1)â‹…(nâˆ’i)

6. Sum of Bitwise AND/OR over all subarrays

    Advanced technique often using the same count formula.

    Example: GFG - Sum of bitwise OR of all subarrays.

ðŸ§  What to master:

    Contribution thinking: Instead of brute force subarrays, flip perspective and ask: "How many times does each element contribute?"

    Monotonic stacks: Efficiently finding PLE/NLE for subarray range counting.

    Prefix sums / cumulative techniques: Often combined with contribution to optimize.

âœ… How to get strong:

    Master Leetcode 907, 2104, and 2281 â€” all three cover increasing difficulty.

    Solve at least 1 problem using both:

        Brute force (for intuition)

        Optimized with stacks/contribution.

    Build a cheat sheet with:

        Count of subarrays containing i: (i + 1) * (n - i)

        Count where i is min/max: (i - PLE) * (NLE - i)
